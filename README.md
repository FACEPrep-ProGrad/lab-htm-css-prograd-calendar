# ProGrad Lab | ProGrad Calendar

## A Quick Introduction

Hey ProGrads, As our entire ProGrad Journey involves a very hectic schedule, we just want to remind you about the importance of time and date to you. To start with, let us try to build a calendar.


## What should you do
```
Fork this repo
Clone this repo
Basic html and css
```

## How To Submit
```
Upon completion, run the following commands:

git add .
git commit -m "ProGrad ID"
git push origin master

And finally, create a pull request so your ProGrad Mentor (PM) can review your work.
```

## Instructions
The starter-code contains all the files, images, and text content needed to create the calendar. The text is in the index.html, and a css file is created in style.css. Font to be used should be Nunito Sans. Remember to follow the best practices.

### Progression 1: Set the mood

Use the background image and CricPro logo to recreate the atmosphere

### Progression 2: Tabulate the scores

Now, using the data in the below expected output, tabulate the scores of our players.

### Progression 3: Let the details Pop up 
Once you have tabulated the scores, create a pop up which opens up on clicking a player's name.

## Expected Output
Here is a screenshot of the expected output.
